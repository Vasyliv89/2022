<p>The Simpsons became one of the first successful projects of the Fox company, winning several outstanding awards. In
    1998, defining the greatest achievements of the 20th century in the arts and the entertainment industry, Time
    magazine named The Simpsons the best television series of the century. On January 14, 2000, The Simpsons was awarded
    a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It is the longest-running American comedy and animated television series. The
    Simpsons still has a powerful influence on modern pop culture. Quotations from the series have entered many
    languages ​​of the world. Homer's exasperated exclamation of "Dow!" (eng. D'oh!) entered the dictionary of the
    English language. The show's quotes and themes influenced many other animated comedies in the late 1990s.</p>
